    "In today's lab session, we will learn how to implement two kinds of cellular automata (CAs). By doing so, we will review many of the fundamental programming tools that we covered in TB1, alongside getting hands on practice of using these skills to implement mathematical models. \n",

    "\n",
    "A cellular automaton consists of a regular grid of *cells*, each of which can be in a finite number of *states* (i.e *on* or *off* as we will use today). An initial configuration for this grid is created by assigning an initial state to each cell. To update the model, each cell is updated in turn according to a fixed update rule that calculates the new state of a cell based on its current state and the state of the cells nearby (known as a cell's *neighbourhood*). CAs have been used to model physical processes in physics (e.g fluid or gas flow), biology (development and growth of tissues), computation, robotics and more. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, we could use a CA to simulate the flow of traffic by dividing the road network into a grid, assigning *off* (or 0) to cells which correspond to sections of road with no cars on them and *on* (or 1) to represents sections which contain cars. \n",

    "\n",
    "For the image above, we would have an initial state of ```state = [1, 0, 0, 1, 0]```. To evolve this model, we would then update these values according to a rule-for example, we could assume each car will move to the right one space if it can (i.e. if the right neighbour cell is a 0). In our CA world, this means that each cell will move one cell to the right if and only if its right neighbour is off and our new state becomes ```state = [0, 1, 0, 0, 1]```.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to start looking at Cellular Automata by implementing some *elementary cellular automata*. An elementary cellular automaton uses a 1-dimensional grid, where each cell has only two possible states (0 or 1) and the rule to determine the evolution of the system depends only on the current state of a cell and its two immediate neighbours. For example, in the image below, the value of the cell at index 4 at time t=1 (shown in red), depends on its own value (shown in green at t=0) and its neighbours (shown in blue). Elementary cellular automata were systematically studied by Stephen Wolfram in the 1980s, with some rules shown to be capable of universal (i.e almost any) computation. \n",

    "plot_grid(grids)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this code, we have a function that creates an initial grid for us (make_grid). We then create an additional variable (grids) to store the grid that was generated at each time step. We then apply our update rule (with the update_grid function) for a number of iterations. Finally, once our model has finished updating, we plot the output. Note that this code contains three functions (make_grid, update_grid, plot_grid) that haven't been written yet. We'll look at how to do this next!\n",

    "At each time step, we need to represent the current state of the cellular automata. For an elementary cellular automaton, this means we need to store a sequence of 1s and 0s. In Python, we can do this by using a *list*. For example, if we wanted to represent an elementary cellular automata of length 10 cells, with all values zero apart from the first cell, we could do this by creating a list with a '1' at the first index, and '0' everywhere else. In code, this would be written:\n",

    "Here, we've used the in-built numpy function *zeros* to quickly create an array of all zeros of the required length. This function requires one argument - the size of the array. One of the key differences between numpy arrays and Python lists is that while a list can contain different types of data (i.e you can create ```python my_list = [1, 'a', None])```, numpy arrays must all be the same type of data. Here, we use the optional dtype argument to specify that we want our array to consist of 8 bit integers (i.e integers represented by 8 bits, allowing us to represent numbers from 0 - (2^8)-1 = 255). As our state will either be a 0 or 1, this is plenty. We've done this to make it easier to plot the output- the program should still execute correctly if you remove it as  numpy will default to using floats instead). \n",

Intuitively, this should have the effect of moving the 1s in the grid to the right. \n",

If our grid has a size of 100, then the rightmost value will have an index of 99. When we try to access element 99+1=100, we'll get an IndexError (as we've tried to access an element of a list that doesn't exist - remember, Python starts indexing lists at 0). The problem here is that we haven't defined the *boundary conditions* for our system. In general, boundary conditions for a system like this can be *constant*, *absorbing* or *circular*, and the correct one to use will depend on the details of the system you want to model. Here, we'll arbitrarily choose to use *circular* boundary conditions, which means that we'll define the right neighbour of the rightmost (i.e index 99) index to be the left most index (i.e index 0), and similarly the left neighbour of the left most index (index 0) to be the rightmost neighbour (i.e index 99). Essentially, we model the road as wrapping around to form a continuous circle. We can implement this by using a series of if-then-else statements, or by exploiting the modulo (```python % ```)operator. This operator returns the remainder when the first argument is divided by the second argument - i.e 5 % 3 = 2, 99 % 99 = 0, 100 % 99 = 1.  \n",

    "\n",
    "In the exercise above, we looked at one possible update rule for our cellular automata. In fact, there are many (256) other rules that we could have looked at. A scheme for understanding the various update rules for elementary CAs was proposed by Stephen Wolfram. The key insight is that as the update rule only looks at 3 cells, and each cells can only be a one or a zero, there are 2^3 = 8 possible states for these three cells. An update rule can then be described by writing down the new value that corresponds to each of these states. For example, the rule we implemented assigned a 1 to a cell if its current value was 0 and its left neighbour was 1. This corresponds to the rule:\n",

    "<h3> Exercise 4</h3> \n",
    "Modify your CA code to include a generalised update_value function. Alongside the current values of the cell and its two neighbours, this function should also take a rule (specified as an integer) as an input. It should then use the update rule that corresponds to that integer to update the grid. Extend your code to optionally read the rule to be used from the command line.
